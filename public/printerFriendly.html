				<p class="info">I am a junior developer ready to enter into a professional environment where I can grow and
					learn what its about to be a part of development team. My professional ambition is, to reinforce my knowledge
					of front and back end design, and become a skilled developer. My training has taught me both how design
					whole apps from design to completion. Although I am applying for my first job as a developer I have developed
					several apps from the ground up to showcase my abilities. Please check out the links below to my portfolio projects.
