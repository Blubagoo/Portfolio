								<li>HVAC-R: This program teaches you how to be a HVAC technician. It takes you through an entire process from how they work, how to install them, and then troubleshooting problems often found inside homes. I did not graduate from this program due to extenuating circumstances. I did however take what I learned and was able to work in the HVAC industry and get a job in Colorado. The program was nine moonths long and I completed a little over half. </li>
